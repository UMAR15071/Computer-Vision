# Computer Vision Based Attendence System
 Welcome to my Computer-Vision repository. In this repository I have developed an application which will allow users to manage attendance using a facial recognition algorithm. For this project I used Python face_recognition library which can be easily installed using pip install face_recgnition. This is an open source library containing different facial recognition algorithms for different scenerios.
 # How to get the source code
 To get this source code you should be able to clone this repository or simply download a zip file and run main.py in your ide.
 # Requirements
 All the dependencies are mentioned in the Requirements.txt
 # Important
 This project was integrated with a database and you may find the database details on my files. You will need to integrate your own database in order to run this file as the current database is being disabled.
 # Database
 The database structure is pretty straightforward you will need to run the Create_Database.py with the details of your own localhost or cloud database. I have used mysql database, which is recomended. Databases like SQLite do not provide required concurrency to make the application run.
